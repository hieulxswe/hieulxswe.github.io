## 🌞 Morning
- 9am: Come in, check emails, arrange short, medium and long-term to-do lists, organize meetings
- 10am: Standup meeting, coordinate day and organize collaboration (if any)
- Then it’s into project work: Carry out coding, problem-solving and development. At various points, you will ask for advice (or give advice). Depending on the environment, you might chat or send a message via Slack, Skype ... If members of your team are free, you might go to a whiteboard together or sit together and then diagram and work out a solution.

Depending on the company, after you find a solution, you’d usually create a “change request” or “pull request” summarising changes proposed, which someone else would review. They might have ideas or solutions of their own.

## 🌝 Afternoon and Project Launches
- When launching a new project, you’re given a list of requirements, and then you would have to create a design document. That’s usually a 2-3 page doc describing the problem and proposed solution.
- Usually, you would say how you’re approaching the issue, and you would discuss other alternatives you have considered and why you rejected them. You would pitch it to your manager and the rest of the team. For these bigger issues or projects, you’d get the go-ahead before you start, and you’d know you’re taking an approved approach and that people are on board with your ideas.
- Depending on the company, after you change your features, then you would usually (alone or with a colleague) deploy the project to production. At this stage, even assuming you’ve tested it rigorously, make sure it runs on your own work computer: You might discover issues after deployment, and you’d have to address bugs based on feedback from colleagues and users/customers.

## 🌖 End of Day
Working day ends, back home & enjoy a beer cold :))
