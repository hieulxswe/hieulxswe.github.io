Are you preparing to break into a career as an iOS developer? If yes, ease the stress and brush up on some of the skills you haven’t used in a while – you are all set to go. Let’s take a look at some of the most important iOS interview questions, which will be a great self-test if you are seeking some practice for your iOS interview.

Here is the list of the most commonly asked iOS developer interview questions and answers for freshers and experienced candidates.

##  1. What is iOS Swift?
**Answer:** Swift is a compiled and new programming language evolved by Apple Inc in June 2014 in order to develop apps for mobile and desktop. This language works for watchOS, macOS, iOS, and tvOS.

Apple created Swift language to work with both Cocoa Touch and Cocoa. Swift supports multiple operating systems such as Free BSD, Linux, Darwin, etc. This language was designed to work along with the Objective-C library and Cocoa framework in the Apple products.

## 2. What are the advantages of using Swift?
**Answer:** Swift programming language has speedily become one of the quick-growing languages in memoir. Swift makes us develop software that is incredibly fast, robust and secure.

This language is the most useful programming language that is used to develop an application for macOS and iOS(iPad and iPhone).

* Open-source language: The Swift programming language has been created as an open-source and is being open to everyone, this makes it simple for the program to upgrade all the source codes, email lists and bug tracker at regular intervals.

* Easy to learn and maintain: Swift programing language is more simple and accurate when compared to C/C++. Apple evolved its programing language to be easy to use and syntaxes are taken from programming languages such as C#, Python, and Ruby. These simple syntax of this programing language make it more meaningful. In swift, all the content of the implementation (.m) and header (.h) files are combined in a single file that is (.swift).

* Supported by multiple devices: Swift programming language is not just limited to support Apple devices, it will also support multiple devices of the technology world like Linux and Windows devices.

* Supports dynamic libraries: Dynamic libraries are the executable chunks of the code that can be connected to an app. This feature allows the latest swift programing language. In swift, dynamic libraries are directly uploaded to the memory, thereby resulting in deduction down on the initial size of the app and finally increases app performance.

* Optional types: An optional in swift is a type that can be held either as a value or not. To declare an optional, we can use a question “?” mark.
Closures: Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in our code.

## 3. What are the most important features of swift?
**Answer:** Some important features of swift are given below:

* More impressive structs and enums
* Protocol oriented
* Optional Types
* Type Safety and Type inference language
* Not required to use semicolons
* Enforced initializers
* Safe by default
* Less code, fewer files
* Forced Unwrapping
* Tuples
* Closures
* Much faster when compared to other languages.

## 4. Is Swift an object-oriented programming language?
**Answer:** Yes, swift is an object-oriented programming language.

## 5. What type of objects are basic data types in swift?
**Answer:**
* Int: int is used to store the integer value.
* Double and Float: Double and Float in swift are considered when while working with the decimal numbers.
* Bool: The bool type is used to store the Boolean value. In swift, it uses true and false conditions.
* String: In String literals, the user defines the text that is enclosed by double quotes in Swift.
* Arrays: Arrays are the collection of list items.
* Dictionaries: A dictionary is an unordered collection of items of a particular type that is connected with a unique key.

## 6. What is the difference between Let and Var in swift?
**Answer:** In swift language, we can declare a constant and variable using Let and Var keyword.
**Let**: **Let** keyword is immutable, it’s used to declare a constant variable, and the constant variable cannot be changed once they are initialized.

For Example: `let myAge = 22`

We cannot change the value of age, you can declare the constant value of it only once using the let keyword.

**Var**: **Var** keyword is mutable, and is used to declare a variant variable. These variant variables can change the run time.

For Example: `var myCat = “Hoshi”`

We can change the value of name = “Kaito”.

## 7. What is init() in Swift?
**Answer:** Initialization is a process of preparing an instance of an enumeration, structure or class for use.

Initializers are also called to create a new instance of a particular type. An initializer is an instance method with no parameters. Using the initializer, we can write the init keyword.

```php
init()
{
// perform some New Instance initialization here
}
```

## 8. What are the control transfer statements that are used in iOS swift?
**Answer:** The control transfer statements that are used in iOS swift include:

* Return
* Break
* Continue
* Fallthrough

## 9. How to add an element into an Array?
**Answer:** Arrays are one of the most used data types in an application (app). We use arrays to organize our application (app) data.

Swift makes it easy to create an array in our code using an array literal. Array elements are simply surrounded by a comma and the list of values is separated with square brackets.

**For Example:**
```php
// Add ‘Int’ elements in an Array
let natural number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

// Add ‘String’ elements in an array
let countryName = [“Vietnam”, “Australia”, “Japan”, “USA”, “India”]
```

## 10. Which JSON framework is supported by iOS?
**Answer:** SBJson framework is supported by iOS. SBJson framework provides additional control and a flexible API which makes JSON handling easier. It is a well and highly flexible framework that supports the flexible functioning of APIs.

## 11. What is PLIST in iOS?
**Answer:** PLIST stands for Property List. PLIST is basically a dictionary of value and keys that can be stored in our file system with a .plist file extension. The property list is used as a portable and lightweight means to store a lesser amount of data. They are normally written in XML.

Different types of property lists are mentioned below:
* Binary Property List
* XML Property List
* ASCII Legacy Property List

## 12. What is a Protocol in swift?
**Answer:** The protocol is a very common feature of the Swift programming language and the protocol is a concept that is similar to an interface from java. A protocol defines a blueprint of properties, methods, and other requirements that are suitable for a particular task.

In its simplest form, the protocol is an interface that describes some methods and properties. The protocol is just described as the properties or methods skeleton instead of implementation. Properties and methods implementation can be done by defining enumerations, functions, and classes.

Protocols are declared after the structure, enumeration or class type names. A single and multiple protocol declaration can be possible. Multiple protocols are separated by commas.

We can define a protocol in a way that is very similar to structures, enumerations, and classes:
```php
Protocol Someprotocol
{
// protocol definition goes here
}
```

We can define multiple protocols, which are separated by commas:
```php
Class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, Firstprotocol, Secondprotocol
{
// Structure definition goes here
}
```

## 13. What is a delegate in swift?
**Answer:** Delegate is a design pattern, which is used to pass the data or communication between structs or classes. Delegate allows sending a message from one object to another object when a specific event happens and is used for handling table view and collection view events.

Delegates have one to one relationship and one to one communication.

## 14. What is the use of double question mark “??” in swift?
**Answer:** The double question mark **“??”** is a nil-coalescing operator, it is mainly a shorthand for the ternary conditional operator where we used to test for nil. A double question mark is also used to provide a default value for a variable.

stringVar **??** “default string”

This exactly does the common thing, if stringVar is not nil then it is returned, otherwise the “default string” is returned.

## 15. What are the collection types that are available in swift?
**Answer:** There are three primary collection types that are available in swift for storing a collection of values. They are dictionaries, sets, and arrays

* **Arrays:** Arrays is an ordered collection of values, which is stored in the same type of values in an ordered list.
* **Sets:** Sets are an unordered collection of unique values, which are stored in a distinct value of the same type in a collection without any defined ordering.
* **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries are an unordered collection of Key and value pair associations in an unordered manner.

## 16. What is the difference between class and structure?
**Answer:** The difference between class and structure are given below:

* Classes are reference types, whereas structs are value types.
* Classes can be built on other classes, whereas struct cannot inherit from another struct.
* Classes have an inheritance, whereas structs cannot have an inheritance.
* In class, we can create an instance with “let” keywords and attempt to mutate its property, whereas there is no Mutability in Structs.
* Classes have Type Casting, whereas struct doesn’t have Type Casting.

## 17. How can we make a property Optional in swift?
**Answer:** Declaring a Question mark **“?”** in the swift code can make a property optional. This question mark **“?”** helps to avoid the runtime error when a property doesn’t hold a value.

## 18. How to write a multiple line comment in swift?
**Answer:** A multiple line comment is written in between the `(/*)` at the starting point and `(*/)` at the endpoint.

## 19. Explain the usage of Class and benefits of Inheritance.
**Answer:**
* Reuse implementation
* Subclass provides dynamic dispatch.
* Subclass provides the reuse interface.
* Modularity
* Overriding provides the mechanism for customization.

## 20. What is Optional binding?
**Answer:** Optional Binding concept is used to find out whether an optional contains a value, and it makes that value available as a variable or temporary constant. We use an optional binding concept to check if the optional contains a value or not.

Optional binding can be used with the condition (if and while) statements to check for a value inside an optional.

## 21. What are the Higher-Order functions in swift?
**Answer:** The higher-order functions are given below:
* Map: Transform the array contents.
* Reduce: Reduce the values in the collection to a single value.
* Sort: Sorting the arrays.
* Filter: Transform the array contents.

## 22. What mechanism does iOS support for multi-threading?
**Answer:** They are:
* NSThread: It can create a low-level thread which can be started by using the “start” method.
* NSOperationQueue: It allows a pool of threads to be created and is used to execute “NSOperations” in parallel.

## 23. Explain Core Data.
**Answer:** Core data is one of the most powerful frameworks provided by Apple for macOS and iOS apps. Core data is used for handling the model layer object in our applications. We can treat Core Data as a framework to filter, modify, save, track the data within the iOS apps. Core Data is not a relational database.

Using core data, we can easily map the objects in our app to the table records in the database without knowing any SQL. Core data is the M in MVC structure.

Some features of Core data are given below for your reference:
* Effective integration with the iOS and macOS toolchains.
* Organizing, filtering, and grouping data in memory and in the UI (User Interface).
* Automatic support for storing objects.
* Automatic validation of property values.
* First framework for managing an object graph.
* Core Data framework for managing the life cycle of the object in the object graph.

## 24. Define Cocoa/Cocoa touch?
**Answer:** It is used for building software codes to run on iOS for the iPad and iPhone. Cocoa Touch is written in the objective-C language and has a different set of graphical control elements to Cocoa.

## 25. What is a nil coalescing operator?
**Answer:** The double question mark operator ?? is known as the nil coalescing operator. It returns the value on the left-hand side if it’s not nil. If the left-hand side is nil then it returns the value on the right-hand side. Nil coalescing can be used as a shorthand for checking if an optional value is a nil. A double question mark is also used to provide a default value to a variable.
