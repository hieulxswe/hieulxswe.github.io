## Introduction
The Swift Algorithms library, unveiled alongside Swift 5.5, stands out as a versatile toolkit offering an extensive range of algorithms. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the core algorithms provided by Swift Algorithms, providing detailed explanations and practical examples to showcase their functionality and usage.

## Understanding Swift Algorithms
The Swift Algorithms library is a testament to Swift's commitment to providing developers with robust tools. It extends the standard library by offering a plethora of algorithms designed for various data structures. The library's mission is to simplify complex tasks, optimize performance, and promote clean, expressive code.

### Sorting Algorithms

`sorted()`: The sorted() function is a cornerstone of Swift Algorithms, providing a concise way to sort arrays and collections in ascending order.
{% highlight c %}
let unsortedArray = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
let sortedArray = unsortedArray.sorted()
print(sortedArray) 
// Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
{% endhighlight %}


`partialSort`: For scenarios where you only need a subset of the sorted elements, partialSort() efficiently returns the top N elements.
{% highlight c %}
let unsortedArray = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
let partialSortedArray = unsortedArray.partialSort(3)
print(partialSortedArray) 
// Output: [6, 5, 5]
{% endhighlight %}

`heapSort()`: Swift Algorithms introduces heapSort(), a versatile sorting algorithm based on the heap data structure.
{% highlight c %}
let unsortedArray = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
let heapSortedArray = unsortedArray.heapSort()
print(heapSortedArray) 
// Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
{% endhighlight %}

### Searching Algorithms

`binarySearch()`: The binarySearch() function efficiently locates elements in a sorted collection, offering logarithmic time complexity.
{% highlight c %}
let sortedArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
if let index = sortedArray.binarySearch(5) {
    print("Element found at index \(index)") 
    // Output: Element found at index 4
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Permutations

`permutations(of:)`: Generating permutations becomes seamless with the permutations(of:) function, providing all possible arrangements of a collection.
{% highlight c %}
let array = [1, 2, 3]
let allPermutations = array.permutations()
print(allPermutations) 
// Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
{% endhighlight %}

### Advanced Algorithms

`zip2()`, `chain()`, and `concatenate()`: Swift Algorithms goes beyond the basics, offering advanced functions like zip2(), chain(), and concatenate() for manipulating and combining collections efficiently.
{% highlight c %}
let array1 = [1, 2, 3]
let array2 = ["A", "B", "C"]
let zipped = zip(array1, array2)
print(Array(zipped)) 
// Output: [(1, "A"), (2, "B"), (3, "C")]
{% endhighlight %}

## How to Use Swift Algorithms

* Import the Library: Begin by adding the import statement at the beginning of your Swift file:
{% highlight c %}
import Algorithms
{% endhighlight %}

* Incorporate Algorithms:
Once imported, Swift Algorithms seamlessly integrates into your project, allowing direct use on arrays, collections, or any compatible data structures.

* Example Integration:
As an illustration, use the sorted() function to sort an array:
{% highlight c %}
let unsortedArray = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
let sortedArray = unsortedArray.sorted()
print(sortedArray) 
// Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion
Swift Algorithms is a powerful addition to the Swift ecosystem, providing developers with a diverse set of efficient and well-tested algorithms. By integrating these algorithms into your projects, you can significantly improve code readability, optimize performance, and tackle a wide array of programming challenges. Embrace the depth and versatility of Swift Algorithms, experiment with various algorithms, and witness the transformative impact on your Swift projects.
