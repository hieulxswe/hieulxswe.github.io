		Welcome to Blog's Hieu SWE ðŸ‘‹ <br>
		My name is <strong>Hieu</strong> (aka. <strong>Brian</strong>). Iâ€™m an Software Engineer in Sydney<br>
		As a young Engineer, I'm curious about how things work and why it works the way it does.<br>
		In this little corner, I do blog about tech (mainly related to Back-End, iOS, Engineering practices or any Stack I happened to work with). If youâ€™re also a geek, check out the Home for technical blog posts.<br>
		Also, I share my views on some random topics.
