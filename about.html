		Welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹ <br>
		I'm <strong>Hieu</strong> (aka. <strong>Brian</strong>), a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> currently residing and working in <strong>Sydney, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º</strong>. <br>
		As a young engineer, I am fueled by a curiosity about the intricacies of how things operate and the underlying reasons behind their functionality.<br>
		In this blog, my primary focus revolves around technology. I delve into topics related to Back-End, iOS, engineering practices, and any tech stack I happen to work with<br>
		Also,  I share my views on some random subjects from my perspective.<br>
		Thanks! Have a nice.<br>
